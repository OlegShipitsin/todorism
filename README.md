## Problem

- Google Sheets are difficult to keep [normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization).
- Trello doesn't have items amount and works best after purchase was done.

## Solution

PWA and website that handle item amount, weight, litres and more. It requires no registration and sms.

npm install && npm start
```
